# Excel Visual Basics for Application Challenge

### Objective
To utilize VBA scripting for stock market data analysis and enhance my programming skills. The goal is to loop through a year's stock data, calculate various metrics, apply conditional formatting, and generate insightful results for multiple sheets.

### Summary
In this assignment, I tackled the challenge of analyzing stock market data using VBA scripting. My objective was to create a script that automates the process of looping through a year's worth of stock data. I successfully extracted essential information such as ticker symbols, volume, open and close prices. By calculating yearly changes, percent changes, and total stock volume, I gained insights into the stock market trends. Additionally, I implemented conditional formatting to visually highlight positive and negative changes. I extended the functionality to run the script across all sheets, ensuring consistent analysis. I captured screenshots of the results and organized my work on GitHub, including separate VBA script files and a README file.
